**📖 Concepts Covered (Day-wise)**

---

✅ Day 1 – User Profile Validation System

Key topics practiced:

* User input and string manipulation
* Validation using conditional statements
* Basic error-checking logic
* Clean and structured output formatting

---

✅ Day 2 – Smart ID & Credential Validator

Concepts included:

* Using lists to store and compare credentials
* Iterative checks with `for` loops
* Rule-based ID validation
* Logical filtering and handling invalid entries

---

✅ Day 3 – Student Performance Analyzer

Main learning points:

* Marks storage and processing using lists
* Loop-based result calculation
* Grade classification using conditions
* Bonus rules based on:
* 4-letter name bonus
* Lucky digit **7** in roll number
* Special topper condition for specific roll–mark match

---

✅ Day 4 – Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer

Important concepts:

* Activity log management using lists
* Risk level classification (Low / Medium / High)
* Logical removal of unwanted entries
* Personalization using last digit of Register Number (D):
* If **D is even** → Low-risk logs removed
* If **D is odd** → Critical logs removed
* Count of removed logs tracked

---

✅ Day 5 – Emergency Resource Dispatch Analyzer

Concepts applied:

* Categorizing emergency requests using loops
* Demand-level classification
* Tracking valid vs removed requests
* Personalized filtering using PLI rule:
* Full name length calculated (excluding spaces)
* `PLI = L % 3`
* Rule A / B / C applied based on PLI value
