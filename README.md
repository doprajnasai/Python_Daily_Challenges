## **📖 Concepts Covered (Day-wise)**


### ✅ Day 1 – User Profile Validation System

Key topics practiced:

* User input and string manipulation
* Validation using conditional statements
* Basic error-checking logic
* Clean and structured output formatting

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Smart ID & Credential Validator

Concepts included:

* Using lists to store and compare credentials
* Iterative checks with `for` loops
* Rule-based ID validation
* Logical filtering and handling invalid entries

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Student Performance Analyzer

Main learning points:

* This Python program takes marks of N students and stores them in a list.
* It processes each mark using loops and classifies students into performance categories (Fail, Average, Good, Very Good, Excellent).
* A personalization rule is applied by comparing the last digit of the entered roll number with a predefined roll number (AP24110011623).
* If both last digits match (3), a +1 bonus mark is added to all students.
* The program also counts total valid students and total failed students.
* Finally, it displays updated marks and performance statistics.

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer

Important concepts:

* Activity log management using lists
* Risk level classification (Low / Medium / High)
* Logical removal of unwanted entries
* Personalization using last digit of Register Number (D):
* If **D is odd** → Low-risk logs removed
* If **D is even** → Critical logs removed
* Count of removed logs tracked

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Emergency Resource Dispatch Analyzer

Concepts applied:

* Lists for categorizing requests
* for loops for classification
* Conditional statements for demand levels
* Counting valid and removed requests
* Personalized filtering using PLI (L % 3 rule)
* Calculated L (length of full name excluding spaces)
* Computed PLI = L % 3 and applied Rule A/B/C accordingly
